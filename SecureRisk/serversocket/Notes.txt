Problem 1: original excel file from the device software is protected, so I really cant read the data from it,
or I dont know how it,

Solution: Opened the protected file and copy the data in the new excel file and then read from there


PRoblem 2= sms commands not read by the device, 
solution = SIM at initialization is in the off state so I have to turn it on using AT Commads
AT+CFUN=1 for ON
AT+CFUN=0 for OFF

AT+CSCA = <String> service center no
AT+CMGF=1
AT+CMGS= "cell no"
